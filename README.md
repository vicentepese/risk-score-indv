# risk-score-indv
Individual risk score computation for RLS based on Shormair et al. (2017) and Didriksen et al. (2020)

### Description 
This small pipeline computes the polygenic risk score given a binary PLINK file and a file with SNPs and ORs used for the computation. Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) is computed using [PRSice-2](https://choishingwan.github.io/PRSice/). More information can be found in their website.
